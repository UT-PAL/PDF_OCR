# PDF_OCR
This Python script performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on a given PDF file using the EasyOCR library. It searches for specific text (provided by the user) in the document and highlights (underlines) the found text with a randomly chosen color. The results are saved as images and then converted back into a PDF.
